# FreestUtils

Was a bit bored and decided to try to program in FreeST ([https://freest-lang.github.io/])

Implemented some usefull functions in utils.fst, including matrixes and some functions to print them, including one to print each integer as a char.

Tried to implement a spinning donut using the algorithm in [https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html], but the code runs to slow. Probably because of the code to write and read from matrixes.
